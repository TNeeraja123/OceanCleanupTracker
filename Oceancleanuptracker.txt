If you want to select at least 4 targets and then prioritize the top 3 among them, here are four targets you could consider:

1. *14.1 By 2025, prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds, in particular from land-based activities, including marine debris and nutrient pollution*: Addressing marine pollution is crucial for the health of ocean ecosystems and the well-being of marine life. It involves implementing measures to reduce pollution from various sources, including runoff from land-based activities and plastic debris.

2. *14.2 By 2020, sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems to avoid significant adverse impacts, including by strengthening their resilience, and take action for their restoration in order to achieve healthy and productive oceans*: Protecting and managing marine and coastal ecosystems is essential for maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem services. This target emphasizes the importance of resilience and restoration efforts to ensure the long-term health and productivity of oceans.

3. *14.4 By 2020, effectively regulate harvesting and end overfishing, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and destructive fishing practices and implement science-based management plans, in order to restore fish stocks in the shortest time feasible, at least to levels that can produce maximum sustainable yield as determined by their biological characteristics*: Overfishing and destructive fishing practices pose significant threats to marine biodiversity and food security. Implementing science-based management plans and regulations is essential for restoring fish stocks and ensuring sustainable fisheries management.

4. *14.5 By 2020, conserve at least 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, consistent with national and international law and based on the best available scientific information*: Conservation of coastal and marine areas is critical for protecting marine biodiversity and ecosystem functions. This target aims to establish marine protected areas and conservation initiatives to safeguard important habitats and species.

Among these four targets, I would recommend prioritizing the top 3 based on their urgency, potential impact, and alignment with your project's goals and objectives
